Address Book Design Overview

Summary
    The application allows the user to manage people's contact information.  Add, edit, retrieve
    contact details.


Use Cases

    User adds new contact to the address book.
        They are prompted to enter the contact's relevant details.  New address book entry is 
        created for this person.

    User searches for specific contact in the address book.
        At the search screen, user fills in the search criteria and begins search.  Results
        screen is populated with list of all contacts that match the search. Selecting any of the
        search results opens a detail view of that contact.

    User browses the address book
        Without providing specific search criteria, the user browses the address book entries
        alphabetically by name in the browsing view.

    User deletes a contact from the address book
        The user opens the detail view of an address book entry (either by browsing to that entry
        or searching specifically for them based on their info) and presses the delete button to
        remove the entry from the address book.

Data Model
    
    Address Book Entry
        - First Name
        - Last Name
        - Address
        - Phone Number
        - Cell Phone Number
        - Fax Number
        - Email
        - Notes


Forms

    Main Form / View
        Main application view.  Allows the user to browse the address book, open the 'Add Contact'
        form, open the 'Search' form, open the 'Detail' form of any of the entries as they browse.

    Add Contact Form
        This is where the user enters the details of a new contact.  When they hit OK on this one
        the new entry is created. Contains all the same fields as the Detail view of an existing
        contact so there is some shared functionality here that can be reused for both. Basically
        an empty version of the Detail view form of an existing contact.

    Detail View
        Displays all the fields of an individual contact.  Allows editing of an existing contact


Implementation Details
    
    Front End / GUI
        Not decided yet which GUI kit will be used. Looking at wxwidgets & Qt.  Would like it to
        be cross platform.

    Back End
        SQLite will be used for the backend persistent storage of the address book.  Realistically
        this is probably a bit of overkill for the amount & type of records in this program but
        that's OK. Learning to use the SQLite API is part of the goal of this project so I'm OK
        with it being overkill.

        
        The back end code will be encapsulated to hide the details of the storage operations
        allowing for replacement of the back end with a different solution while maintaining
        the same interface to the core application code.
